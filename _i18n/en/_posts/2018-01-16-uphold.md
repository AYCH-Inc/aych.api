Uphold members can now utilize InstantSend for DASH transactions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

####

Today, we are happy to announce support of [InstantSend](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/InstantSend), yet another great feature from DASH offered on the Uphold platform. Since our initial launch of DASH in [December 2017](https://uphold.com/en/blog/posts/uphold/dash-is-now-live-on-uphold), our team has been working to implement InstantSend which provides members with access to a faster transaction confirmation reducing the time it takes for funds to arrive at the recipient's DASH wallet.

How to initiate a DASH InstantSend transaction within your Uphold wallet:

Please Note:

-   Uphold enables faster deposit times for DASH transactions sent using InstantSend
-   Withdrawals can be expedited using InstantSend. However, the destination must also support InstantSend. If the destination/recipient does not support InstantSend, the transaction will be processed by the destination/recipient as a regular DASH transaction*
-   If you are unsure if the destination/recipient supports InstantSend please confirm before sending as Uphold is unable to confirm this information
-   The InstantSend DASH network withdrawal fee is 0.001 DASH

As always if you have questions regarding your Uphold account, please contact <support@uphold.com>

-The Uphold Team

**The InstantSend fee is non-refundable if a destination/recipient does not support InstantSend the transaction will be processed at the destination/recipient as a regular DASH transaction. **\*
