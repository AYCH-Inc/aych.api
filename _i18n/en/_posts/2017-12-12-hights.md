It is not just Bitcoin that has experienced a great surge in price. Although not on the same scale as Bitcoin, Dash cryptocurrency is running all time highs, with it quickly approaching $730USD.

Dash investors have experienced somewhat of a roller coaster over the last couple of weeks. Despite a lot of alt coins suffering distress because of Bitcoins success, but this is just not the case for Dash. What's more is that the Dash price has grown adjacent to both Bitcoin and the US dollar. At present, no other cryptocurrency in the top ten list has seen this much growth.

In a month Dash has grown by almost $200, which, despite the success has left some rather concerned. There is an inadequate supply of coins that can be acquired from the open market. Instead, a large quantity of the coins is locked up in masternodes, which give valuable services to the Dash system. However, it appears that these concerns should not be put at the forefront, as it seems the Dash price increase is far from over.

Dash has managed to avoid any key developments in the crypto-world up until now, and it will be interesting to see if things stay this way. The current price increase is pretty outstanding all things considered, but it should be noted that all good things must come to an end. Dash's trading volume is tough. Over $600million USD have changed hands in just a few hours, proving that it is very obvious that people are willing and eager to invest in this cryptocurrency.

Dash is a minority cryptocurrency, which has long lived in the shadows of Bitcoin, but with this new price surge, it is obvious that there is a lot of support for this altcoin, even if this is all based on assumptions. It is unsure what will happen when the market turns unpleasant and the price plummets, but this surge is, in itself an achievement and it shows that the coin is constantly evolving and developing.
