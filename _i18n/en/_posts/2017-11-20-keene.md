Recent [drama behind the scenes with Bitcoin](https://freekeene.com/2017/11/08/bitcoin-not-forking-again-after-all-good-riddance-to-segwit2x-long-live-bitcoin-cash/) has resulted in the world's most popular and oldest cryptocurrency, that sadly can't scale to increased demand, and as a result, has [escalating, ridiculous fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3m).

Luckily, thanks to an NH-based upstart from the Seacoast called [Anypay](http://anypay.global/), now merchants can accept [DASH](http://dash.org/) at point-of-sale. In fact, here in Keene, New Hampshire, local mom-n-pop retailers Corner News, Hot Hogs BBQ, D's Cafe, and Route 101 Local Goods all now accept DASH at the register via the Anypay app.

It's a relief to be able to use cryptocurrency again retail in real life, with fees that are sane. Fees for sending are usually no more than 1-3 cents' worth of DASH per transaction, and they're expected to [get even lower with DASH's next upgrade](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/11/11/dash-lower-fees-bitcoin-visa/). Compare that with Bitcoin's recent, insane $10+ median fees recently. Over the last couple of days they've dipped, but are still over $6 worth of BTC just to send a transaction. It's sad -- Bitcoin is broken, yet amazingly continues an upward trend in value, just today setting a new record high of over $8,000 USD per BTC.

Right in the midst of the DASH retail explosion happening in both [Portsmouth](http://freestatebitcoin.com/2017/09/27/portsmouth-smoke-and-vape-bitcoin-preferred/) and Keene, [Lamassu](http://lamassu.is/), the manufacturer of [Keene's first Bitcoin Vending Machine](https://freekeene.com/2015/04/23/new-improved-bitcoin-vending-machine-launches-in-keene/) released a long-awaited system update that has expanded their software to allow for multiple cryptocurrencies to be vended. Since DASH is uniquely positioned as "digital cash" and has growing point-of-sale support in the Keene area, it is now the first additional cryptocurrency besides bitcoin to be offered as a vended product in this region.

That means DASH is now available in Cryptocurrency Vending Machines (CVMs) across southern New Hampshire! In June, [Portsmouth became the first city](https://freekeene.com/2017/06/13/new-hampshires-first-vending-machine-to-offer-dash/) to offer DASH in its vending machine(s). One month later, [Manchester's original Bitcoin Vending Machine](https://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/811/bitcoin-atm-general-bytes-manchester-usa-murphys-taproom/) at Murphy's taproom [had added DASH](https://freekeene.com/2017/07/19/manchester-bitcoin-vending-machine-adds-dash-making-nh-1-for-dash-vending/).

[Route 101 Local Goods](https://www.route101gifts.com/), the location of Keene's CVM, is at 661 Marlboro Rd. and is open Mon-Sat 10a-6p, and Sunday 11a-5p. They accept multiple cryptocurrencies at the register and offer some really cool NH-sourced, hand-crafted products for sale. It's a perfect place to do all your holiday shopping.

Thanks to Lamassu (originally based in Manchester, NH) for the system update to allow people to have a choice in the crypto-marketplace. If you're a crypto-libertarian and you aren't planning a move to NH, here are [101 Reasons](http://101reasonsfilm.com/) why you should.
