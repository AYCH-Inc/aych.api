Video repost of episode 35 of the three amigos podcast. This week we celebrated the fourth anniversary since the launch of Dash and discussed some of the industry-changing innovations Dash has pioneered along the way. We also talk about Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor keynote presentation at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami and look at the details of the announcements.

The 3 amigos podcast takes place every Friday at 3pm EST / 8pm GMT.
