Digital payment currency [Dash](https://www.dash.org/) today announced a partnership with [Bitnovo](https://www.bitnovo.com/), the Spanish cryptocurrency payment platform, to allow consumers to purchase Dash in more than 10,000 retailers throughout Spain. The partnership sees Dash available for purchase with coupon in thousands of stores and in selected Carrefour and Media Markt outlets through the purchase of gift cards.

"As the subject of cryptocurrencies finds its way into conversations around the globe, the primary barrier to widespread adoption of digital assets remains the same," Dash head of legal Fernando Gutierrez said. "While there is incredible eagerness to enter this arena, the convoluted path to entry remains a significant roadblock for most interested parties.

"Creating a platform that is open and accessible to all has been a core value since our inception. Partnering with Bitnovo gives us the chance to make accessing our unmatched currency as easy as buying a loaf of bread in your local market," added Gutierrez.
