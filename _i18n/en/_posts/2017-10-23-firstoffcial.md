This week was a very important one for Stride, Cryptogroup, Dash and Ukraine in general.

By leveraging DAO of one of the most successful cryptocurrency Dash, we've been able to make it a general sponsor at International Security Conference "Bezpeka 2017". That was rather valuable experience and we're excited for sponsoring this event.

In order to make the experience even more interesting, we've made a really important move --- the first public purchase of a software between 2 companies in cryptocurrency.

This purchase was backed by a contract signing from both sides which makes it the first ever official purchase of its kind in the whole world.

The participants of this event:\
- [Oleksandr Kurinnyi](https://www.facebook.com/oleksandr.kurinnyi/), CEO of [AxxonSoft](http://www.axxonsoft.com/)\
- [Olexandr Turin](https://www.facebook.com/aleksandr.tiurin.3), CEO of ITX\
- [Dmitriy Baimuratov](https://twitter.com/dmitriybtc), Dash representative in Ukraine

This event was covered by multiple TV channels and was featured in dozens of Ukrainian news outlets.

On top of that, we showed people how to use cryptocurrency at our Dash cafe. Up to 30 people have tried this amazing technology, the feedback was outstanding.
