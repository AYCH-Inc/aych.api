Crypto Payments--On the Rise?
----------------------------

While this is the first major shopping mall in South Korea to announce that it will be integrating cryptocurrency as a payment method in its stores, some other major retailers in [South Korea ](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/young-people-s-korea-among-hardest-hit-shrinking-crypto-markets/)have already made the move.

In late November of 2017, Goto Mall (South Korea's largest underground shopping center) announced that it was [partnering with local crypto exchange HTS Coin](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/now-accepting-bitcoin-rise-btc-retail/) to develop the tools necessary to start accepting Bitcoin.  Together, the mall and the exchange built a smart payment system and a mobile app that made the process of accepting BTC for small purchases more streamlined.
