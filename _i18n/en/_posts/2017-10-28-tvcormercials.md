Cryptocurrency is becoming part of mainstream culture, with [Wall Street contemplating crypto trading operations](http://coinreviews.io/goldman-sachs-bitcoin/), and now cryptocurrency TV commercials hitting airwaves.

Recently, Twitter was abuzz due to a recent tweet from CryptoRick ([@LittleRick42](https://twitter.com/LittleRick42)) regarding a Dash commercial seen on a United Airlines flight.

In the tweet, CryptoRick states that he saw the commercial on the airliner's tv, with another user [@Cryptotweetfool](https://twitter.com/cryptotweetfool/status/915721081725612032) verifying that he, too, saw the TV commercial.

It appears United Airlines uses DirecTV as their television provider. With DirecTV being a major television provider, this could mean that Dash is not only running in-flight commercials but could also be open to running commercials viewed in households nationwide. This is a huge step for mainstreaming cryptocurrency and bringing awareness to the industry.

We recently discovered Dash's marketing plans for this campaign which can be found in their [advertising proposal idea](https://www.dashtreasury.org/p-4a64fec0343e7a09adfe357b0f187c803b23d543ee284940310e143dcca66529.prop) as well as in their [renewal request](https://www.dashtreasury.org/p-b0d7abb61eef32800cf917bb95021f678cd0d659cf58509bd2f880e0b041bb53.prop) which outlines the objectives. For advertising geeks, it's a must read. 

What is Dash?
-------------

When it comes to mainstreaming cryptocurrency, more and more people are learning about the three major coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin; however, many are still unaware of altcoins, [like Dash](https://www.dash.org/) which also have billion dollar market caps.

Dash is decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash. It is intended to be used like liquid cash. Dash differs from Bitcoin due to its enhanced privacy, quick transactions, and negligible transaction fees.

Dash was founded in January 2014 by Evan Duffield and was [originally named XCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(cryptocurrency)). It was later renamed DarkCoin, and in March 2015 was given the name of Dash.

Currently, Dash has over a $2 billion market cap and is available on all major exchanges including Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex, and Livecoin.

Now that Dash is running broadcast TV commercials, will other coins follow? Time will tell as to who next jumps on the trend with mainstream media. Either way, this a significant event in the history of cryptocurrency.
