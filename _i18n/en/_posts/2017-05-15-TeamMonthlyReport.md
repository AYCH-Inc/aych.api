Dear Community Members,

It is my pleasure to give you a status report of the Dash Core Team activities. Below, you will find our report covering activities performed in March and April, grouped by the four strategic areas of focus for 2017.

Software Development
Dash core wallet - version 12.x (lead developer: Andy Freer)
New releases: v.12.1.3; v.12.1.4; v.12.1.5
Internal restructure partly due to growth and partly due to some opportunities w/personnel. We’ve also nearly doubled the size of the team with new recruits.
Dash Evolution (lead developer: Jon Kindel)
Whitepaper in the process of finalization. Version 0.1 of the Evolution paper released to the technical leaders for first review.
Developing a cohesive DevOps strategy with an automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This will ensure that we move away from cowboy-style ops and deployment, and reduce bus factor (the organization is not dependent on any single person).
Single Github org for Evolution development created and we are consolidating all repositories into that place.
Established an agile workflow with daily stand-ups for the entire Evolution dev team. This lays the groundwork for enabling the Evolution team to more easily collaborate among sub-teams, as well as move forward quickly with development and releases and in an agile manner.
Dash wallet for Android - updated features (lead developer: [USER=463]@HashEngineering[/USER])
Dash wallet for iOS - updated features (lead developer: [USER=2025]@QuantumExplorer[/USER])
