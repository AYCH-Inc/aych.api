Description
Dashwallet is the first iPhone wallet for Dash - Digital Cash - a better innovative alternative to bitcoin.

Dash is a crypto currency that seeks out fix the flaws that other crypto currencies suffer from. It relies on a network of Masternodes to allow such things as anonymity, instant transaction, and direct funding mechanism to kickstart innovative ideas.

Intuitive and secure, dashwallet gives you complete control over your digital cash. Send and receive dash payments instantly, with the safest mobile wallet available.

Dashwallet is the first and only iPhone wallet which connects directly to the dash network. This means that there are no servers to get hacked or go down - your funds are always safe. Even if your phone is lost, damaged or stolen, you can easily recover your funds using your personal recovery phrase. 

Dashwallet is the descendant of breadwallet, a Bitcoin wallet for iPhone. We commend Aaron Voisine, creator of breadwallet, for his work. In Dashwallet we kept the beautiful simplicity that makes breadwallet a great bitcoin wallet.

Features:

* Send and receive dash payments in seconds, online or in person
* Send payments to merchants that only accept bitcoin directly with Shapeshift.io
* One button payments to dash-accepting merchants and websites
* Store your dash safely and securely using built in hardware encryption
* Simple recovery phrase enables you to recover funds when your device is lost or broken
