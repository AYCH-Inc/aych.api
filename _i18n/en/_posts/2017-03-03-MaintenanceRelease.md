title: "- - 0.12.1.3 Release - - (Maintenance Release - ALL USERS) --"
---
ALL users are encouraged to update to 0.12.1.3 ASAP. 
*All 24/7 nodes (mining pools, masternodes, exchanges, merchants etc) should consider this update as a MUST.*
(no protocol bump, so all 12.1 MNs are paid - pre 12.1.3 have a risk of unexpected crash once spork2 is on again)

Mandatory update for all :
- Users
- Pools
(no code changes in pool software needed, replace daemon - done)
- Masternodes
- Exchanges
