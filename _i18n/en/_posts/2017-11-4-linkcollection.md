### General notes:

During most of its history Dash has been under constant attacks, many of which trying to portray Dash as a failure. This is oxymoronic, because nobody hates on failures, especially not for 3+ years. We're still here and we're not going anywhere (except maybe well past the moon ;).

Remain skeptical towards sensational accusations without evidence. Our community is helpful, knowledgeable and more than happy to answer any questions, as we have done many times on this subreddit. Still, we're all only human, have limited resources and we're just one project among many (though a resident Top 10). Stakeholders and investors of other projects will always have an agenda to smear what they perceive as competition (I have yet to see our community actively go after other projects, though).

Just remember the Bullshit Asymmetry: "The amount of energy required to refute bullshit is at least an order of magnitude larger than to produce it." So it would be very unjust to expect a refutation on the spot all of the time. Prefer taking the initiative by asking the community directly about the claim you're confronted with. This community has proven many times to possess the integrity required to admit to technological shortcomings, but at the same time we'll never hesitate to call out illegitimate claims and accusations, of which there are many, for what they are.

The most common and most empty attack is "Dash is a scam". 

-   Dash has surpassed its all-time high price several times
-   Its developers are publicly known, many by full name
-   It's still being developed after almost 4 years with an incredible track record of under-promising and over-delivering, a game-changing roadmap & a clear vision of the future
-   Its technology works as advertised and remains objectively superior to Bitcoin and many other currencies
-   Myriads of projects copied Dash's features
-   Look at the wealth of in-depth information linked on this page alone. Look at all the interviews, articles, news shows, podcasts, presentations, conferences, infrastructure, the people.... Does this all really look like a grandiose scam?

More importantly you have to ask the critic just this one question: Who was scammed? The answer usually consists of complete silence or attempts to change the topic.

Regarding Dash's finances: Despite what many people assume influenced by the ICO insanity of the recent past, Dash did not have an ICO and Dash does notdepend on 3rd party funding/investors. It is self funded from the blockchain and thus an entirely independent organization that does exactly what it wants, not what any angel investors want us to do. Dash is the first currency in history to achieve that. In fact Dash pioneered almost every single one of its features making it one of the most prolific innovators in the cryptocurrency space. Before Dash invented them, none of these features existed:

-   X11: power saving hashing algorithm
-   Dark Gravity Wave: highly reliable difficulty adjustment
-   Sporks: Multi-phased forking technology avoiding hard forks during network upgrades
-   Masternodes: Incentivized full node infrastructure through split of mining reward
-   PrivateSend: protocol level coin mixing without the flaws of CoinJoin
-   InstantSend: instantly confirmed double spend proof transactions
-   Treasury: Self-funding by splitting of block reward
-   Blockchain Governance: Voting rights for those who provide our network's backbone
-   Evolution platform technology: Under heavy development but making rapid progress towards true digital cash so user-friendly that even your grandmother could use it

To re-iterate a previous point:

Dash has been copied by several dozen other projects either completely or through selected features indicating a strong approval of its technology within the wider cryptocurrency industry. The most copied feature by far is the Masternode system and the financial self-reliance it provides.
