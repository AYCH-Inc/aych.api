“Dash is now supported on all GENERAL BYTES #bitcoin ATMs. Ask your local ATM operator to enable Dashpay today <http://thndr.me/zZnUM3>”
Recently the GENERAL BYTES Bitcoin ATM models have been upgraded to support Dash, the 6th largest cryptocurrency in the world. You can do your part to help increase Dash adoption in the ATMs by supporting this Thunderclap event.
We need a minimum of 100 people to support us in our goal. (*supporting us is free!) All it takes is a minute of your time and you will be able to support us using your Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr account. The Dash community will be grateful so what are you waiting for? Your favourite cryptocurrency needs you!
