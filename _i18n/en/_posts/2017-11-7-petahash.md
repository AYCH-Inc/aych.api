DASH Breaks Petahash Barrier
============================

NOVEMBER 6, 2017 BY [P2POOLMINING](https://www.p2poolmining.us/author/p2poolmining/) [LEAVE A COMMENT](https://www.p2poolmining.us/dash-breaks-petahash-barrier/#respond)

We knew it was only a matter of time...

With the recent rise in mining hash rates for DASH, it looks like the big mining farms have discovered DASH.

Total HASH RATE for DASH exceeds 1 PH/s

The Total Hash Rate for DASH has just exceeded the **PETAHASH** barrier for the first time ever. This is a level of hashing that Bitcoin reached in 2013, as per Coindesk's Article titled [Bitcoin mining difficulty soars as hashing power nudges 1 Petahash.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-soars-hashing-power-nudges-1-petahash/)

This is a major milestone for DASH and if all factors are considered, we predict to see the Difficulty begin to rise exponentially too.

DASH difficulty rises above 40 million

In fact, with this sudden rise in hashing power we are seeing an exponential rise in the **difficulty** levels too. This may not be a good sign for miners, but those people invested in DASH should soon expect to see some exponential growth in the value of their DASH holdings.

To the Moon!!
