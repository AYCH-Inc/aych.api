**DashMasternodeTool v0.9.11 released:**

-   initial support for Ledger Nano S wallets (no sending funds feature yet); thanks to [@chaeplin](https://www.dash.org/forum/members/206/) , this part was super easy
-   additional data (downloaded from dashcentral.org) in the proposals window, as: proposal owner, title, payment months, etc
-   fixed 'couldn't lock mutex' error
-   fixed 'on_btnSaveConfiguration_clicked() missig 1 required positional argument' error
-   a message shown while waiting for confirmation with the hardware wallet's button
-   fixed errors occurring when closing and quickly re-opening the proposals window
-   dates/numbers displayed according to the user operating system's settings
-   keepkey support: fixed the 'Cancelled' error occurring when entering an empty passphrase
-   a few other improvements and error fixes

Ledger Nano users, before you move your collateral to your Ledger, please test the functionality of signing messages using the "Tools-> Sign message..." feature. If this works, then there should not be a problem with starting masternode, as this feature internally uses the message signing function.

Next, I will be focused on finishing support for Ledger Nano S by implementing sending funds feature, that will allow "withdrawing" masternode earnings in a secure way for the masternode's collateral.
