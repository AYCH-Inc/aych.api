      Lead evolution developer Andy Freer has been locked away producing huge amounts of documentation for the various concepts of Evolution. This comes after months of conversations between Andy and myself about how each component of Evolution works, then reimagining it and improving the components and designs systematically.

      Since the original research phase, documentation, specifications, plans and diagrams have been being drafted, growing into a collection of documents that will be put into a wiki with full documentation for Evolution’s end-to-end design and implementation.

    evolution-research-heading: EVOLUTION RESEARCH
    evolution-research-text:
      In January 2016 we released an early Evolution prototype based on Electrum. Since then, we have been creating reams of documentation and have completely outlined the design goals and begun implementing them.

      The prototype was pretty basic, with user interaction limited to just paying a few friends and user data stored on a dev server, but at least it proved the concept.
      What we set out to do then was to design and prototype all the key technologies that would make these functions work in a purely P2P way, with data secured on the Dash blockchain and accessible from anywhere on any device, with integrated SPV based security and no centralized intermediary services required, and using the most common and censorship resistant protocol available – HTTP(S)

    launching-heading: LAUNCHING DATES
    launching-text: >
      Launching a new software release on the network requires that all budget proposals be re-submitted into the system.

      Due to the timing of superblocks, we have a short window to launch, near the beginning of the month. In order to ensure we launch the most stable possible version of the software without interfering with the budget system, we would like to hold off until early February to launch 12.1. Launch date: February 5th, 2017.
