    architecture-heading: Next-Gen Network Architecture
    architecture-text:  
      <p>The core of Dash's unique technology is a 2-tier P2P network design that rewards users that hold Dash to host a type of supernode called a Masternode and host it 24/7 on dedicated hardware.</p>
      <p>Masternodes work together in clusters and can't be faked like fullnodes in other digital currencies. This means they can provide new kinds of decentralized services, like instant transactions, anonymization and governance, without the threat of low-cost network attacks.</p>

    governance-heading: First Self Governing, Self Funding Protocol
    governance-text: <p>Any important project of decision in Dash is agreed and funded by a decentralized public process that funds projects autonomously based on Masternode-netwok votes. This means Dash can fund it's own growth and adoption, consensus is guaranteed, and everyone is accountable to the network. And you can't game the system without buying over have the currency supply.</p>
