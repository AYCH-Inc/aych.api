Masternode Owners: Today a proposal was submitted which our system didn't catch (comma in the decimal) and this broke Sentinel, which means watchdogs stopped being created. We have pushed a hotfix, but Masternode Operators must intervene in order to update Sentinel (unless using some auto-update system).

To implement, simply move into your "sentinel" directory and run a git pull:

Code:

cd /path/to/sentinel/ && git pull

Note: This is required or your Masternode will go offline!\
(edit: Apparently w/spork 14 off this isn't enforce, so crisis averted!)

Thank you for your service to the community.
