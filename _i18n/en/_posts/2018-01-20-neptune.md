Neptune Dash to Commence Trading on TSX Venture Exchange, Provides Dash Masternode Operations Update and Welcomes Strategic Shareholders
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jan. 18th, 2018

VANCOUVER, Jan. 18, 2018 /CNW/ - Neptune Dash Technologies Corp. ("**Neptune**" or the "**Company**") is pleased to advise that the common shares of the Company will commence trading on January 22, 2018 on the TSX Venture Exchange, under ticker "DASH" as a Tier 1 Technology Issuer. Neptune is also pleased to provide an update on its Dash Masternode operations and to welcome two strategic shareholders to the Company, including a large institutional investor.

**Dash Masternode Update**

Neptune exclusively builds and operates Dash Masternodes and invests in Dash Blockchain related technologies. Neptune currently operates 15 Dash Masternodes and has acquired 15,134 Dash and anticipates operating approximately 17-18 Dash Masternodes by January 31, 2018 and acquiring an additional 2,000 to 3,000 Dash, as each Dash Masternode requires 1,000 Dash as collateral. The Dash Blockchain currently compensates Dash Masternodes at a rate of 6.86 Dash per month. Since operations commenced, Neptune has realized a projected annual return on its Dash Masternode investment of approximately 7.7% not accounting for appreciation in market value. Neptune's average Dash acquisition cost is roughly $1,025CAD ($820USD).

Cale Moodie, President and CEO of Neptune states, "We are very pleased that Neptune's procurement strategy has enabled us to acquire Dash at a very reasonable average price since the financing closed. We are excited for the continued growth of the Dash network and adding to our Masternode pool throughout 2018".

Dash is a digital currency created to address Bitcoin's scaling challenges. Dash Masternodes facilitate the following functions on the Dash Blockchain:


a.


facilitating private, peer-to-peer transactions directly between parties;


b.


serving as a governance function and voting on treasury disbursements of the Dash block-reward allocated to the Dash DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization); and 


c.


facilitating transactions that are processed near instantly on the Dash blockchain (versus the target three minute block time for average Dash transactions).
