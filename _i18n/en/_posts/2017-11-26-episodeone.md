The merchants of Venice
=======================

Stephen Baldwin has a plan: to start a conversation with everyday Americans about what America means to them. Joining forces with his good friend, Max Keiser, they embark on a pilgrimage to do just that by grabbing Stephen's dogs, gassing up an RV and hitting the road. But first, they sit down with a cafe owner and local residents of Venice Beach before traveling out to Riverside, CA to get back to Southern California's roots: a family-owned citrus farm.
