Dash is back in the news, dominating the daily feed in regard to digital currency dynamos. Boy, you would not have guessed this much traffic for anything other than bitcoin in the digital currency space about a year ago. It looks as though Dash is lighting the furnace under bitcoin, turning up the heat for the digital payments industry. The company has announced a partnership with Wall of Coins that will essentially allow people to buy and sell Dash from a nearby bank or financial services branch.

Dash users will soon be able to exchange the third most valuable cryptocurrency at major national banks to likes of Chase, B of A, and Wells Fargo, in addition to service companies like MoneyGram and Western Union.

The partnership provides the growing rate of Dash traders and investors with the option to convert cash to Dash (oh wow, very catchy) almost instantaneously. Given Dash’s meteoric rise in the past year, the partnership struck with Wall of Coins is paramount for the continuation of progress.

Dash Director of Finance Ryan Taylor commented, “One of the biggest barriers for consumers getting into a new cryptocurrency like Dash is obtaining their first coins. With most services, there is a lot of friction involved. You need to sign up for an account, verify your identity, wait for account approvals, and transfer funds from a bank account. The entire process can take days. Wall of Coins makes this process much simpler, and allows users to purchase Dash immediately at tens of thousands of physical locations in twelve countries. And since Wall of Coins is supporting our InstantSend feature, transactions leveraging the Wall of Coins system will be blazingly fast. It also gives the community another way to sell their Dash, often at a premium to the rates available on traditional exchanges.”

Wall of Coins is known in the industry as a web based platform that allows users to buy Bitcoin and Dash with paper cash, or sell Bitcoin and Dash for cash via a P2P format.

Robert Genito, Project Director at Wall of Coins said, “We have become the first service to let people get Dash directly with paper money, and by far the fastest marketplace for it. It took us a little while, but we realized why Dash was so important in this industry; it truly is a great gift to the world. Although Bitcoin purists had immediately disregarded it and gave me pressure for talking positively about the protocol, Dash is really focused on giving people and business what they truly want: instantly-settled payments, privacy, optional transparency, and the ability to fix problems quickly.”
