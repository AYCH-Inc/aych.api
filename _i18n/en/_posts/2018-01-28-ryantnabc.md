"Dash is a consumer-friendly currency, we're aiming to bring ease-of-use to both the merchant and the consumer, and we're aiming to bring other best practices from the payments industry into cryptocurrency." *Bitsonline* caught Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor right after he spoke at the North American Bitcoin Conference 2018 in Miami to chat about his project's latest (and most ambitious) plans.

Dash in 2018: Four Major Initiatives
------------------------------------

TNABC was almost more of a Dash conference than a bitcoin one, with the project sponsoring signage and ID passes. And that's part of Dash's strategy --- a portion of the mining rewards from every block it network mines goes into something called the "Treasury", which helps fund development, marketing and outreach campaigns.

You need to be able to match existing services if you want cryptocurrency to get mass adoption, Taylor said. And while privacy remains an optional feature for Dash users, it's just one many these days --- user friendliness is the one that will take Dash forward.

On the main speaker stage, Taylor introduced four new major Dash initiatives for the coming year: Piico, which just ditched Bitcoin for Dash due to fees; Strike Social for YouTube ads; the U.S. Department of Energy and smart meters; and integration with GoCoin's huge network of merchants.

To get all the details on why these are important for Dash, watch the whole interview here:

Growth of the North American Bitcoin Conference
-----------------------------------------------

![North American Bitcoin Conference TNABC logo](https://bitsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/TNABC_logo_small.png)The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) is regarded as the original [major Bitcoin event](https://btcmiami.com/) in the USA, and possibly the world. Held annually in Miami every January since 2013, it staked that city's claim as Bitcoin's fun and business capital --- growing from a few hundred bitcoin enthusiasts into a gathering of thousands, including several high-profile industry leaders. It's a must-attend event on the blockchain calendar.

[Produced](https://btcmiami.com/team/) by Dr. Moe Levin's Keynote Events team, it now covers all disruptive blockchain technology issues --- including smart contracts, ICOs, fintech, regulation and investment. TNABC also has international sister events, such as World Blockchain Forum in London.
