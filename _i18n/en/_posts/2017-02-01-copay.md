title: Copay-Dash Wallet (Testnet Only / RC 0.1)
---
I’m happy to announce a “Release Candidate” version of Copay-Dash, a variant of the Copay wallet which was originally developed by Bitpay.

Besides the usual characteristics of other wallets, this fully-featured app boasts:
- The ability to access multiple Dash wallets within a single app
- HD-Multisignature Wallet Derivation (BIP32/BIP44)
- Exchange Rate Calculation (150+ currencies)
- Multilanguage Support
- Streamlined User Interface

Copay is available for all major operating systems, both desktop and mobile, however at the moment the Dash version will be made available only as a Chrome extension. This release has undergone preliminary testing but at this stage is intended only for Testnet. Once we’ve achieved 100% stability we plan on distributing builds supporting additional platforms.

Backend Mechanics

This wallet is powered by Bitcore Wallet Service <https://github.com/dashpay/bitcore-wallet-service-dash> and uses a centralized server to do the heavy lifting. This server maintains a full copy of the blockchain and provides notifications to connected clients when transactions affecting their wallet occurs, similar to how an Electrum Server operates. It’s worth noting that despite this “client-server” relationship, your private keys are always held locally and are never revealed to the centralized server.

Copay-Dash is able to maintain this “untrusted” relationship with the wallet server through the use of Bitcore Wallet Client <https://github.com/dashpay/bitcore-wallet-client-dash>. This collection of client-side libraries allows for the signing of Transactions and creation of Wallets to occur via API.
