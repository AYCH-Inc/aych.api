The digital currency Dash held its first conference this past weekend in the Oval Space in London. The conference was pre-funded by Dash’s treasury system, where projects are funded directly by the Blockchain. A portion of each block reward is withheld to fund such proposals, if the currency’s owners vote in favor.

Over 500 were in attendance and almost 1000 more watched live streams of the event. Presenters touched on all aspects of Dash, including the upcoming Evolution update. Wirex, a Bitcoin debit card company, announced they will be integrating Dash fully into their platform. According to Cash Alternative TV, the Wirex card will have full support for both PrivateSend and InstantSend:


Future plans

Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor gave a sneak peak of future partnerships that will be announced over the next few months, including:

Global brokerage service with free bank transfers
New exchange integrations
Dash will have access to 20 new fiat currencies
An additional ATM manufacturer
Integration with several large retailers
A healthcare integration
Few details were given, but Taylor mentioned that the community should expect press releases to be coming soon.

Keeping it low key

Ryan Taylor is notoriously stingy when it comes to anything that might resemble hype. Recently, he and founder Evan Duffield penned an open letter to the Dash community. In response to repeated proposals to use unallocated budget funds for marketing, Taylor stated:

“Any gains from this type of advertising would be temporary. As soon as the marketing is removed, the artificial influx of investments would deteriorate followed by the price. Wild price appreciation and crashes would actually detract from Dash’s utility as a currency and medium of value transfer, thus directly working against our stated mission and vision. We encourage the community to take a longer-term view to their investments and refrain from hyping the coin… there is plenty of hype inherent in the industry already.”

Taylor has consistently supported a relatively low-key approach as Dash continues to build its ecosystem and its Evolution update. It’s not surprising, then, that Dash Conference 2017 failed to reveal any earth-shattering announcements. Any major news in the future will likely come by means of a press release, rather than at a splashy conference.
