Dear Masternode Owners and Community Members,

Please see attached our Dash media coverage report for the period July 1, 2017 - October 31, 2017 This is the third month WPR using Cision's software, and they have introduced some updates that have improved the report. This month we have included new tabs that will help us gauge our monthly performance comparing and contrasting Dash with competitors "Bitcoin" "Ethereum" "Litecoin" and "Monero."

In the contract period, Dash was placed or mentioned in **8,614 articles**. In attachment 1, you will find the [Dash Media Placement List](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/43778137/2017-11-03%20-%20Attachment%201%20-%20Dash%20Media%20Placement%20List.csv?api=v2), which pulls media appearances that mentioned or featured the words "Dash" within the reporting period. The total reach of these articles was **9.46 billion views**. Because the Cision software only allows a maximum spreadsheet limit of 5,000 entries, we have refined the attachment to show the most significant appearances.

In attachment 2, you will find the [Dash Graphical Report](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/43778137/2017-11-03%20-%20Attachment%202%20-%20Dash%20Graphical%20Report%20.pdf?api=v2), which contains an 8-page summary of our success during the contract period. The 8 slides are pretty self-explanatory, however, Slide 8 is a little difficult to read exact media hits per region. Because of this, I have provided the numbers of media placements by country below for your convenience.

In attachment 3, please find a [sentiment report ](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/43778137/2017-11-03%20-%20Attachment%203%20-%20Dash%20Pos%20and%20Neg%20.pdf?api=v2)over the past four months showing the most significant positive and negative media appearances for Dash. What is interesting, articles with negative sentiment are not strictly negative about Dash.
