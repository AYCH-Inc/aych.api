> Dear Masternode Network and Community Members,\
>\
> As promised in another thread, I am sharing a Dash project portfolio report from Dash Core Group.\
> The report contains synthesized information abut delivery status of all our development streams. We are still working on new form of reporting, so please consider it a temporary format.\
>\
> **General comments about the work status**\
>
> -   Majority of developers are being involved in DIPs creation and finalisation. DIPs are technical and functional specification of Dash Evolution.Â 
> -   Above causes "ON HOLD" status in majority of Evolution development activities
> -   After DIPs are being finalised, project plans are going to be updated and roadmap re-defined (with all dependencies included)
> -   The team is intensively hiring missing resources
> -   Dash Core Group management works on the legal structure finalisation and internal org structure
> -   PM team works on delivery model and internal processes
> -   Majority of risks are caused by lack of resources and work on DIPs (these risks are being mitigated already by hiring and delivery model preparations)
> -   The report contains only status of development projects that are not confidential (e.g. it excludes ongoing integrations and BizDev work)
>
>\
> Please find the report attached.\
> Thank you.
