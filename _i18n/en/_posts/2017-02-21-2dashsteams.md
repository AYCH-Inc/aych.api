Privacy-focused altcoin DASH [rocketed](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dash/) to a new all-time market cap high of $168.7 mln Sunday as its price cracked $23.

Continued enthusiasm behind the coin and in general altcoin trading has ensured the asset remains a firm favorite with an increasing number of speculative investors.

The highs are a far cry from the DASH of even a year ago, which traded at just 0.08 BTC per coin.

A raft of integrations in the past weeks have additionally helped introduce the coin to a wider audience.

Most recently, Cointelegraph [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dash-maidsafecoin-at-new-highs-on-wave-of-altcoin-optimism) its debut on exchange BitMEX to much fanfare, while European Bitcoin ATMs can now be retrofitted to also deal in DASH as well as Bitcoin.

The Slovakian crypto app developer CryptoDiggers is responsible for the upgrade, which can be made to BTMs operated by [General Bytes](https://www.generalbytes.com). Currently, the latter has around 16 percent of the global number of BTMs in existence.

“The first digital currency that can offer real electronic untraceable cash will be very successful. The Dash team is on the right path towards accomplishing this feat,” BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes commented last week.
