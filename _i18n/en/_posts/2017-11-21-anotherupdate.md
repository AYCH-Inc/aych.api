Every active node started/paid before or 2 days after the release is paid again now, so payment cycle is complete and SPORK_10_MASTERNODE_PAY_UPDATED_NODES is ON meaning that only upgraded (12.2.x / 70208) nodes are going to be paid from now.

On another note, we are 250+ blocks into new DIP0001 voting period (4032 blocks, ~1 week). So far 90% of blocks are signaling DIP0001 and we need 80%+ support for this period in total at the block 778176. Looking good
