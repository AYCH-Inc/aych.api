The apparent query will be why and how, that too within a small period. It has been increasing in price value owing to several reasons, amongst them a current upgrade plus the chaotic phase in which Bitcoin, as well as Bitcoin Cash, have been going through. The upgrade also repairs the flaws, bugs, plus it perks up the [cryptocurrency system](https://www.applancer.co/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-cryptocurrency). Another fraction of the Dash Evolution upgrade, which is predicted for late next year which aspires to make cryptocurrency extremely simple to utilize, so that everybody can gain from it. [Dash currency's network](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/dash-hits-new-all-time-high-as-bitcoin-bitcoin-cash-struggle/) is only one of its kinds, as it assigns about 10% of block rewards to finance projects.

More willingly than setting up payment channels like Bitcoin's experimental Lightning Network or else the Ethereum planned Raiden Network, Dash aims to utilize ultra-large blocks. Dash's founder Evan Duffield had posted on Medium formerly this year which read as:

> "Many projects in the space believe that on-chain scaling is unfeasible. That's only for the reason that they haven't explored alternative P2P architectures for higher performance. We aim to show just how far incentivized the second tier [master node] architecture can take a project similar to Dash."

Dash is an involuntarily transmuting unidentified cryptocurrency. It operates a decentralized governance along with budgeting system, thus making it the first decentralized autonomous organization.
