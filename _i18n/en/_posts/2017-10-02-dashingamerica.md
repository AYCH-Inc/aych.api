We started our RT and Dash financed Great American Pilgrimage (GAP) journey across America. And here are some photos from the set so far.

We began in Los Angeles and have driven through to Denver so far. All has been sunny along the way.

Here are some photos of me and Max on the first day of production taken by Peter Duke, who I call the 'David Bailey of Santa Monica.' (And Bailey is actually a friend of mine, so I should know).

Notice the DASH t-shirt!?

All has not, however, been fun and sun. Here is, for example, how cranky I look when having to wakeup at 4am for an early morning start time:

And we have managed to keep working on Keiser Report. Here's a still from an upcoming episode this week and recorded in Denver:

I feel so blessed to have been able to experience some of the most stunning scenery on earth. So far, what has really stood out is the parts of Arizona and New Mexico through Navajo Nation:

The iPhone just doesn't do it justice. The first photo was taken at the Arizona/New Mexico border. And the second photo was taken north of Gallup, NM heading toward Colorado. A journey worth putting on your bucket list.

Anyway, back to some production meetings. But remember, if you see the DASHmobile on the road, wave to us!
