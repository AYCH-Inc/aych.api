You asked for Dash and we heard you!
------------------------------------

####

We are excited to share that starting today, Uphold members can now buy, hold and convert value to [Dash](https://www.dash.org/) with just a few clicks, right from their Uphold account. Our members are active in requesting new features and currencies, recently Dash has been a frontrunner as a request from members as well as partners. We have watched DASH grow at a breakneck pace, nearly 6,300% since January of this year! With the addition of Dash to the Uphold ecosystem, it is by far the easiest method yet for consumers to acquire the popular cryptocurrency.

At Uphold, we were eager to add Dash primarily due to the increased adoption and of real-world use cases. The organizational structure of Dash, with masternodes and proposals and the Core Group, is a recipe for long-term success, especially at a time where the vast majority of the top one-hundred blockchains and currencies are still primarily speculative. Dash excels in e-commerce and payments via digital currency, and is a rising alternative to bitcoin. Dash offers a form of money that is portable, inexpensive, divisible, and fast. It can be spent easily and instantly online at merchants across the globe, at much lower fees than credit and debit cards. 

*"Uphold adds to the Dash ecosystem the fastest and easiest method yet for everyday consumers to acquire Dash. Dash already has many of the world's largest digital currency exchanges integrated, but exchanges are generally intimidating for average users unaccustomed to trading. Uphold makes transactions much simpler than an exchange, and it supports users from most geographies. All of this means that another great option is available to consumers around the world at unmatched speed and remarkably low cost." CEO of Dash Core, Ryan Taylor*

We make buying, holding, converting and sending Dash easy for anyone to understand and anyone to do - just as we've done for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and any of the[ 30+ other currencies we support](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/202473803-Supported-currencies).
