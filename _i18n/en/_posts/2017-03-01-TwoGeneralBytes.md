The anonymity-focused cryptocurrency DASH, which became the third most valuable digital currency today when it reached a market capitalization of $229.2 million, recently got its first ATM machines in Bratislava, Slovakia. 

The DASH-dispensing ATM is manufactured by General Bytes, and is owned by Slovakian fintech company, CryptoDiggers. 

CryptoDiggers' ATM allows anyone to purchase DASH anonymously in amounts up to €5000 per transaction. The ATM applies a 3.7% fee on buys and a 2.4% fee on sell transactions. The new DASH ATM was installed inside the FreshMarket, located on Rožňavská 1a street, Bratislava. 
"We placed one-way Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash ATM for you in Bratislava. We are looking forward to you," said [CryptoDiggers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CryptoDiggers/status/836621623386071040)

This ATM is one of two General Bytes machines to implement the recent software upgrade, which was released by the CryptoDiggers 4-person developer team, that enables DASH alongside Litecoin and Bitcoin.

A second CryptoDiggers DASH ATM also came online today in the OC Danubia Shopping marketplace in Bratislava, located on Panonska cesta 16 Street, according to [CoinAtmRadar](https://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/1379/bitcoin-atm-general-bytes-bratislava-oc-danubia-shopping/)

Including today's installations by the CryptoDiggers team, there are now three DASH-supporting ATMs in the world; the Cash2BTC ATM, located at the Bitcoin Center in NYC, also supports DASH, but it requires SMS verification and has 10% fees.
