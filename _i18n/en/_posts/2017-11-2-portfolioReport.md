Dear Masternode Network and Community Members,

Let me share project portfolio review report done this week.Please note that this is very basic report - the team works on different model of reporting.

**General Comments**

-   Majority of developers is being involved in DIPs finalisation. The work on DIP is progressing as planned.
-   Developers' workshop is being planned between 13th and 18th November. During the workshop DIPs are going to be finalised and confirmed.
-   After DIPs are being finalised, project plans are going to be updated and roadmap re-defined (with all dependencies included).
-   Project Managers are working on delivery model and processes in parallel to DIPs creation efforts.
