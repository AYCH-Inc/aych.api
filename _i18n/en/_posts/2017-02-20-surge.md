---
Privacy-centric digital currency DASH - the sixth most valuable cryptocurrency in the world - rallied 10% today to an all-time high of $23.88. At approximately 11:40 EST on Sunday, the DASH/BTC exchange rate on U.S.-based exchange Poloniex hit a 176-day high of 0.0227.

The novel digital asset was in a downtrend during the second half of last year, hitting a low price of 0.01 on December 23, 2016. But several technical improvements, growing network security (hashrate/masternodes) and  [rising adoption](http://www.razor-forex.com/2017/02/anonymity-focused-cryptocurrencies-dash.html) have propelled the value of DASH upward during the first 45+ days of 2017.

The market capitalization of the DASH network also hit an all-time high today: $168.74 million, according to [Coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dash/)

The hashrate of the DASH blockchain, which is secured by the X11 algorithm, has been steadily rising since July of 2016, growing to a record 2.6731 Th/s on January 24, 2017 (5x increase since July 4th).

Investor confidence in privacy-focused DASH has been bolstered by strong network growth metrics, however, investor interest soared after Czech-based Bitcoin ATM manufacturer, General Bytes, announced support for DASH on their BATMTwo and BATMThree ATM models on February 10th.

At present, there are 162 General Bytes ATMs installed in various countries. General Bytesâ€™ teller machines currently make up 16.06 percent of all Bitcoin ATMs installed in the world, according to data by [CoinAtmRadar](https://coinatmradar.com/charts/#by-manufacturer).

While DASH is not supported by default on General Bytes ATMs, individual vendors can choose to support DASH via an upgrade from [CryptoDiggers Team](https://www.cryptodiggers.eu/), a European blockchain services firm.

Furthermore, General Bytes also launched a DASH [Thunderclap campaign](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/52838-bring-dash-to-your-local-atm) on Twitter to get the word out about the ATM upgrade. 

At press time, the DASH/BTC rate has retraced from its 176-day high of 0.0227 down to 0.0217:
